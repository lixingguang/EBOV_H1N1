## Naming convention for alignments

* `l2014.aln`: All sequences from l2014
* `l2014.unique.aln`: All sequences from l2014, only uniques retained
* `l2014_w_outgroup.aln`: All sequences from l2014 plus appropriate outgroup
* `l2014_w_outgroup.unique.aln`: All sequences from l2014 plus appropriate outgroup, only uniques retained

Note that we need to distinguish between duplicate strains (as in two sequences from the same patient) and duplicate sequences (two sequences share no mutations). We will use the word "duplicates" or "no-duplicates" to refer to duplicate strains, and the word "uniques" to refer to sequences with at least one difference.
