\begin{abstract}
Gire et al.\ (\emph{Science} 345:1369--1372, 2014) analyzed 81 complete genomes sampled from the 2014 Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak and claimed that the virus is evolving far more rapidly in the current outbreak than it has been between previous outbreaks. This assertion has received widespread attention, and many have perceived \citet{Gire2014}'s results as implying rapid adaptation of EBOV to humans during the current outbreak. Here, we show that, on the contrary, sequence divergence in EBOV is rather limited, and that the currently available data contain no signal of rapid evolution or adaptation to humans. Gire et al.'s findings resulted from an incorrect application of a molecular-clock model to a population of sequences with minimal divergence and segregating polymorphisms. Our results highlight how indiscriminate use of off-the-shelf analysis techniques may result in highly-publicized, misleading statements about an ongoing public health crisis.

\noindent
Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) is currently devastating West African populations in an unprecedented epidemic that has begun to spill over into many parts of the world. Since its discovery in the 1970s, EBOV has, at regular intervals, caused zoonotic outbreaks in human populations. Unlike past outbreaks, however, the current EBOV outbreak shows sustained transmission among humans, prompting concerns that as the outbreak escalates, EBOV may evolve to become endemic in humans. Recently, \citet{Gire2014} published 78 genomes from the current outbreak, sampled during May and June of 2014 in Sierra Leone. They analyzed these new data, in combination with three EBOV genomes collected in Guinea during March 2014 \citep{Baizeetal2014}, and reported ``a rapid accumulation of...genetic variation.'' They additionally stated that ``[t]he observed substitution rate is roughly twice as high within the 2014 outbreak as between outbreaks.'' The conclusions ultimately left readers, and indeed the scientific community at large, with the impression that EBOV is fast-evolving and possibly adapting to humans (see also \citealt{NatureEditorial,Lukszaetal2014}). 

By contrast, we do not find any robust evidence in the available 2014-outbreak EBOV genomes supporting these conclusions. While it is clear that mutations are certainly occurring in EBOV, the available genomic data do not show concrete evidence that EBOV is evolving rapidly, much less accumulating mutations. In fact, among the 81 published genomes from the current outbreak, there are only 29 unique sequences (two from Guinea and 27 from Sierra Leone), and no genome contains more than 2 nonsynonymous mutations.

To put EBOV's evolutionary dynamics into context, we compared the extent of genetic diversity within 2014-outbreak EBOV genes to the genetic diversity accumulated by influenza H3N2. This virus, known as the ``Hong-Kong flu," has been the dominant seasonal influenza strain since its emergence in 1968, and it is the archetypal rapidly-adapting human virus. Like EBOV, influenza virus is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. We constructed gene trees for EBOV nucleoprotein (\emph{np}) and polymerase (\emph{l}), selecting only genes from the 2014-outbreak EBOV sequences (Figure~\ref{ebov_flu}A). \emph{np} and \emph{l} have accumulated the most sequence diversity of all seven EBOV genes during this outbreak, and thus they likely represent the most rapidly-evolving EBOV genes. We constrasted these phylogenies with gene trees for H3N2 hemagglutinin (\emph{HA}) and nucleoprotein (\emph{NP}) (Figure~\ref{ebov_flu}B) for sequences collected within a single month (December 2012) in a small geographic area (Boston, MA). \emph{HA}, the influenza surface protein responsible for host receptor-binding, is under intense selection pressure to evade host immunity, and at least 5\% of \emph{HA} sites experience positive selection \citep{Bushetal1999,MeyerWilke2013}. \emph{NP} is not exposed on the viral envelope and evolves relatively slowly, with only 0.6\% sites under positive selection \citep{Linetal2011}.

As the juxtaposed gene trees in Figures~\ref{ebov_flu}A and~\ref{ebov_flu}B clearly demonstrate, even the fastest-evolving EBOV sequences from the 2014 outbreak are evolving much more slowly than H3N2 sequences do at similar temporal and geographic scales. Indeed, even the slowly-evolving influenza \emph{NP} far outpaces EBOV genes in terms of accumulated genetic diversity. Furthermore, the average root-to-tip and pairwise distances among the EBOV genes \emph{np} and \emph{l} from the current outbreak are approximately an order magnitude lower than the distances observed for the H3N2 genes \emph{HA} and \emph{NP} (Table~\ref{distances}). Thus, EBOV is simply not accumulating mutations in a manner we would expect from a fast-evolving virus.

In fact, even considering all EBOV outbreaks since 1976, we find very limited evidence for evolutionary divergence, on par with the divergence observed in influenza virus in a single month (Table~\ref{distances}). Figure~\ref{ebov_flu}C shows a phylogeny of all EBOV sequences considered in \citet{Gire2014}, as well as related ebolavirus species. The extent of sequence divergence across EBOV sequences collected from 1976 to present pales in comparison to divergence among ebolavirus species. The minimal sequence divergence among, and within, EBOV outbreaks indicates that the current EBOV outbreak should be considered a single, polymorphic population. Indeed, the mean pairwise sequence similarity among unique 2014-outbreak EBOV genomes is 99.84\% (standard deviation of 0.39\%). Moreover, according to \citet{Gire2014}, there are least 55 segregating mutations in the 2014-outbreak EBOV sequences, yet these mutations generally do not co-occur in any particular genome. For example, among these EBOV genome sequences, only three (two from Sierra Leone and one from Guinea) contain two nonsynonymous mutations, no genome contains three or more nonsynonymous changes, and there is no evidence that any given site has experienced multiple mutation events in the current outbreak.  

Taken together, these results reveal that EBOV sequence data must be analyzed in a population genetics, rather than a purely phylogenetic, context, which \citet{Gire2014} failed to recognize. For example, \citet{Gire2014} found that the 2014-outbreak EBOV substitution rate is elevated relative to a baseline EBOV substitution rate, measured from pooling all sequence data collected since 1976 (Figure 4F in \citealt{Gire2014}), by inferring the rate of a strict molecular clock. Given the minimal divergence of the 2014 sequences, this approach is fundamentally flawed. The molecular clock assumes that sequences have sufficiently diverged such that all differences are fixed substitutions rather than segregating polymorphisms. As a consequence, the rate of the molecular clock is highly time-dependent, such that the substitution rate is substantially elevated at short time-scales due to the confounding presence of segregating polymorphisms \citep{Hoetal2005, Hoetal2007, PetersonMasel2009, Hoetal2011}. Thus, that \citet{Gire2014} observed an elevated substitution rate within the 2014-outbreak sequences is actually an expected outcome and does not provide any evidence for accelerated evolution. Instead, it is merely a signal of the minuscule divergence among these sequences. Until more time has passed and mutations have either fixed or been removed from the population, results concerning EBOV substitution rate are unreliable and inconclusive.

%Finally, we offer a word of caution when incorporating sampling times into phylodynamic analyses, as is commonly done when analyzing viral sequence data \citep{beast}. It is important to recognize that including sampling dates is only justified when viral sequences are sampled from a single viral population. For viruses endemic to humans, such as influenza and HIV, incorporating sampling times into an analysis can help clarify hypotheses on viral origins and transmissions, by showing how each sequence branches off the underlying viral phylogeny trunk. Unlike influenza and HIV, however, EBOV is not currently endemic to humans, and thus including sampling dates for sequences collected from humans can greatly mislead analyses. In particular, \citet{Gire2014} showed two EBOV phylogenies, one built without date information (Figure 2A in \citealt{Gire2014}) and one with date information incorporated (Figure 2C in \citealt{Gire2014}). These phylogenies have dramatically different topologies. Specifically, when dates were incorporated, the tree topology showed outbreak groups branching off temporally from a constant trunk. Yet, as each EBOV outbreak has occurred due to distinct zoonotic transmissions, there is no reason to expect that the different EBOV outbreak groups should be temporally ordered down the phylogeny, and incorporating dates under these conditions biased inferences to produce spurious tree topologies.

In sum, we do not find any convincing evidence in \citet{Gire2014}'s study supporting their conclusion that EBOV 2014 sequences are rapidly evolving. As more sequence data from the current outbreak are collected and made available for analysis, evidence may emerge to support these claims. However, until such data are released, we cannot conclude that EBOV 2014 sequences show signatures of increased evolutionary rate, much less of adaptation to humans.
