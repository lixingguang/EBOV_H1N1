SJS. 
All trees here were made with the command "FastTree -nt -gtr -nosupport <aln> > <tree> ", using the script ../scripts/build_trees.py
Files are named according to corresponding alignment, but with .tree extension.

The summary file "tree_stats.txt" was created w/ script ../scripts/calc_tree_stats.py . By default, stats were calculated for all trees in phylogenies/.
Statisitcs include - 
1. Tree length (sum of all branch lengths)
2. Mean root-to-tip. ONLY consider for trees which do *not* have the outgroup included. With outgroup = artificially inflated.
3. Mean patristic distance. Similarly, ONLY consider for trees which do *not* have the outgroup included. With outgroup = artificially inflated.
