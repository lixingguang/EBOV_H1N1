SJS. This top summary added manually.
1. np has 4 aa, 11 nuc informative columns    = 7/11 synonymous
2. l has 5 aa, 16 nuc informative columns     = 11/16 synonymous
3. gp has 3 aa, 3 nuc informative columns     = 3/3 NONsynonymous *** <- this is the host-binding one!! 
4. vp24 has 1 aa, 3 nuc informative columns   = 2/3 synonymous
5. vp30 has 0 aa, 2 nuc informative columns   = 2/2 synonymous
6. vp40 has 1 aa, 4 nuc informative columns   = 3/4 synonymous

From here below was generated with sanity_aln.py. Shows informative columns (columns which contain more than 1 aa nucleotide) for unique sequences of each gene, restricted to 2014 outbreak.
