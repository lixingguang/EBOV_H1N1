This directory contains all alignments used.

The file "align_stats.txt" contains nucleotide-diversity statistics for several alignments. It was calculated by executing:
    ../scripts/run_calc_pi.sh
in the present directory.


## Naming convention for alignments

* `.aln`: alignment, fasta format
* `_unique.aln`: alignment, fasta format, only uniques retained
* `_w_outgroup.aln`: alignment, fasta format, with appropriate outgroup
* `_w_outgroup_unique.aln`: as `_w_outgroup.aln` but only uniques retained

Note that we need to distinguish between duplicate strains (as in two sequences from the same patient) and duplicate sequences (two sequences share no mutations). We use the word "duplicates" or "no-duplicates" to refer to duplicate strains, and the word "uniques" to refer to sequences with at least one difference.
